The aim is to classify blood cell images into one of four classes. The procedures for training, testing, and evaluating the CNN model are implemented in this notebook.
Developing classification models to predict cardiovascular disease from preprocessed ECG measurements.


This project involves the analysis of an ECG (electrocardiogram) dataset to diagnose cardiovascular diseases, which are a leading cause of global mortality. The objective is to develop classification models for binary classification: determining if an individual has cardiovascular disease or not. The dataset contains ECG profiles and corresponding disease status. The goal is to predict the presence of cardiovascular disease using ECG measurements, which are sequential sensor data. The data is preprocessed and normalized.
